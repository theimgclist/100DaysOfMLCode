**Day 9 - 15th July, 2018:** Continued the training  
* Yesterday, I trained the model for close to 2 hours  
* Training was interrupted  
* Started the training again today  
* It has been more than 5 hours so far and the loss has come down to 1.2  
* As the loss reduced to 3, the learning got slower  
* Letting the model to train, I used the saved checkpoint so far to try object detection  
* The model was not able to detect gun from the image I used  
* Maybe I should wait for the loss to come down or try another image  
* Training needs patience!

* The loss has been fluctuating a bit, going up once in a while  
* Training would have been faster if only I used higher batch size  
* But that needs more memory and computation  

**What to try next :**  
* Continue the training   
* Tweak the model if necessary
