**Day 37 - 16th Aug, 2018:** Face Landmarks Detection    

* Couple of days back, I read about face landmarks/fiducial points 
* Facial landmark detection is a key part of face extraction/recognition  
* Using the same Dlib library that was used for face detection, face landmarks can also be detected  
* I used the code from yesterday's face detection and modified it with the help of Dlib's example

* Dlib's face landmark detection example provides a trained model to detect the face landmarks
* Using the trained model, landmarks can be detected for a given image
* OpenCV is used to plot the landmard points on  the input image
