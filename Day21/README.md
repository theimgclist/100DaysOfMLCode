**Day 21 - 31st July, 2018:** Kaggle Ship Detection, Run Length Encoding, Blender       

* Been thinking to get started with some on-going Kaggle competition   
* [Airbus Ship Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection) started a day ago  
* This Kaggle competition is about detecting ships from satellite images  
* After working for sometime on object detection, I thought I could give this challenge a try  
* But what real-time use does detecting ships have?  
* According to Airbus, shipping traffic is growing fast(Yeah, I never thought of traffic problems on sea either!)  
* This can lead to ship accidents,illegal fishing, trafficking etc  
* There is also a speed constraint for this challenge  
* Challenge is to detect ships from test images and to build a model that can do it quickly  
* Going through the discussion page, I came across **Run Length Encoding**  

**What is Run Length Encoding?**  
* It is kind of a data compression algorithm  
* To better understand it, let's take an example  
* The string **AAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBCCCCCCCCCCAAAAA** can be compressed and encoded into **13A5B10C5A**   
* It is not hard to interpret, as all we did here is to take each character and its frequency   
* By doing so, we were able to represent 33 characters using only 10 characters   
* As one can notice, it is not hard to decode it to original string  

**Got close to getting started with Blender**  
* Downloaded and installed Blender  
* Blender is a free open source software used to create graphics, animations, 3D models etc  
* BlenderGuru Youtube channel has very useful tutorials for beginners  
* Went through some tutorials    
* Even simple dimension and view changes look fancy!!  

**What to try next :**   
* Get into the details of Kaggle Competition  
* Try Blender using the tutorials
