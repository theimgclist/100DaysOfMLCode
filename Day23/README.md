**Day 23 - 2nd Aug, 2018:** Finished Blender Fundamentals Tutorial        

* Select objects in Blender using mouse right click  
* Right click is chosen to make other actions easy which need left click  
* Using a mouse with middle button and a keyboard with numpad is recommendable  
* Numpad and mouse operations can also be emulated with other combination of keys  
* Press Shift + A to add more objects  
* Object mode is the default mode on Blender  
* Modeling and transformation can be done in Edit mode  
* Can change mode by the panel at the bottom  
* Press Ctrl + Tab in Edit mode to choose vertex?edge/face of the mesh that you want to edit  
* Layers make it easy to work on different mesh/objects  
* Extrude is a very useful feature using which a mesh/object can be quickly transformed into many other shapes  
* Textures are patterns/images projected onto materials  
* For example, a wall with brick texture  
* Textures make objects look more realistic
