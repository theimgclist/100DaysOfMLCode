**Day 71 to 77 - Oct 16th to 22nd , 2018:** Built an Identity Management Webapp

* As part of the 2-Day hackathon, we built a webapp that uses face verification for check-in and check-out
* The model used for face detection and verification worked decently(Tested it on other hackathon participants)
* I have been working on transforming the app since then
* By altering and adding code and functionality, I now transformed it into an Identity Mangement app
* As the below demo shows, a new user can first register by submitting deomgraphic details and face
* The verification page helps in checking if the user is registered
* If a match is found, clicking on View Identity fetches the registered user's details
* If no match is found, the user can go back to register page and submit the details
* All of this together form identity management
* There are many other features that need to be added
* This is still a work in progress..
