**Day 35 - 14th Aug, 2018:** Face landmarks/Fiducial Points     

* Face detection and recognition takes several things into consideration  
* Facial landmark detection is a key part of face extraction/recognition  
* Facial landmarks are nothing but the coordinates of key facial features  
* They give us a boundary of the face along with the location of features like eyes, nose, mouth etc  
* These are also called Fiducial Points

* Detecting fiducial points is a fundamental step in face recognition  
* Eyes, lip edges, nose, chin etc are some of the fiducial points  
* Detection of these fiducial points gives us an outline of the face  
* Dlib is an opensource library that makes it easy to detect face landmarks and extract face from an image
