**Day 65 to 67 - Oct 5th to 7th , 2018:** Attended TensorFlow Roadshow Bangalore and published a blog

* TensorFlow Roadhow, which is a community event was organised in Bangalore
* It was a full-day event and it had many useful talks and sessions  
* Opensourced in 2015, TensorFlow has become the most loved library of 2018  
* It has been evident over the past few months, how TensorFlow's team has been paying attention to the community's feedback  
* There were talks about useful TensorFlow features and APIs  
* Estimators, tf.data and Keras are high level APIs that make building and  training ML models easy
* Eager mode and Autograph try to simplify the complex style and functionality of TensorFlow
* TensorFlow supports distrubuted training which brings down the training time from days to hours
* TPUs are Tensor Processing Units that offer huge computations to quickly train models
* TensorFlow Extended, TFX is an end to end ML platform that provides libraries to validate and analyze data  
* TFHub is a repository of reusable ML models which can be easily used for inference
* Magenta is TensorFlow's project for applying Machine Learning to art and music  
* Thanks to this roadshow, we not only got to attend informative sessions but also interacted with TensorFlow and Google Brain team

* Here is a blog that I published - [A Day in TensorFlow Roadshow â€“ Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-day-in-tensorflow-roadshow-dae64b470fe7)
