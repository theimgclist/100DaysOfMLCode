**Day 36 - 15th Aug, 2018:** Face Detection    

* The first step in any face processing task is to detect the face  
* This can be from an image, a camera feed or a recorded video  
* Face detection is nothing new as even cameras as old as a decade could do it  
* The same task acts as a preliminary step for more advanced face processing tasks  
* This is done for assisting more sophisticated tasks like face recognition, emotion analysis, age detection and projection etc

* There are several ways to detect faces from some face input source  
* It can be easily done using Dlib
