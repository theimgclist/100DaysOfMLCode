**Day 31 - 10th Aug, 2018:** Read more papers

* Started with SfSNet as the main reference paper for the research on face reconstruction  
* Didn't know much about how face decomposition works  
* SfSNet was quite useful and it has references to many other useful papers  
* Understanding the Physics and some of the terms involved in face decomposition and reconstruction took some time

* The above chart shows how different components of the architecture are connected and the loss functions used  
* Thanks to my team - Ankita and Shreyas who helped in putting things together    
* Read few other papers which really helped in understanding inverse rendering better  
*

* AutoEncoders can be used for input denoising  
* In this case, the input image to the autoencoder will be an image or other data with some noise  
* From its prior learning, the autoencoder helps in denoising the input image

* Though autoencoders can be used for data compression, they are not as efficient as existing compression methods  
* Autoencoders are currently used for dimensionality reduction and denoising
