**Day 10 - 16th July, 2018:** More training..  
* I left the model to train since yesterday  
* It has been training close to 30 hours!!  
* Tried to check the results from a saved checkpoint  
* The model gave bad results  
* Though the loss has now decreased close to 0.6, the results were poor  
* Either the training data was not enough or I should try a different pre-trained model  
* I used ssd_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28 for the current model  
* Will try next with faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28

* This trained model didn't give expected results  
* Something to learn from this failure  
* Pre-trained models are handy and helpful. But it doesn't mean we can settle with a specific one!   

**What to try next :**  
* Add more training data   
* Try a different pre-trained model
