**Day 24 - 3rd Aug, 2018:** Physics in Face Reconstruction         

* Physically based rendering (PBR) refers to the concept of using realistic shading/lighting models along with measured surface values to accurately represent real-world materials  
* Rendering or image synthesis is the automatic process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D model by means of computer programs  
* The concept of energy conservation states that an object can not reflect more light than it receives

* Albedo is the base color input, commonly known as a diffuse map  
* Bump mapping is a technique in computer graphics for simulating bumps and wrinkles on the surface of an object

* Raster graphics, also called bitmap graphics, are digital images that are composed of tiny rectangular pixels, or picture elements, that are arranged in a grid or raster of x and y coordinates   
* In order to calculate the shading of a 3D object, need to know the intensity, direction and color of the light that falls on it  
* Shader is a  small script that contains the mathematical calculations and algorithms for calculating the Color of each pixel rendered, based on the lighting input and the Material configuration  
* Light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. This is known as ‘inverse square law’ and is similar to how light behaves in the real world  
* The mesh geometry of an object only gives a rough approximation of the shape while most of the fine detail is supplied by Textures  
* A texture is just a standard bitmap image that is applied over the mesh surface. You can think of a texture image as though it were printed on a rubber sheet that is stretched and pinned onto the mesh at appropriate positions
