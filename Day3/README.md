**Day 3 - 9th July, 2018:**  Object Detection on live camera feed   
* Tried object detection on live camera feed    
* Used the same setup as object detection done on single image  
* Installed opencv   
* Used ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_coco as the pre-trained model  
* The model is run on a Windows 10 laptop with 8gb RAM,i5 processor and no GPU
* There was near real time object detection
* There was a slight change in detection speed between integrated webcam and a USB camera

**What to try next :**  
* Code and share a Colab notebook with full environment setup and code for object detection
