**Day 13 - 19th July, 2018:** Set up Raspberry Pi  
* I recently got a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+   
* This is the first time I had a Pi  
* Setting up Raspberry Pi was easy      
* Thanks to the official Raspberry website  
* It has an easy get started guide([here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-getting-started))    
* Installed Raspbian OS  
* VNC-Viewer is a handy tool    
* It is a graphical desktop sharing tool similar to Remote Desktop on Windows

* Want to quickly play some music on Pi?  
* Use omxplayer from the terminal     
* Use + and - for changing volume    
 
**What to try next :**   
* Install TensorFlow and other packages on Pi  
* Get Pi ready for object detection
