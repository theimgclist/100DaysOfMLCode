**Day 28 - 7th Aug, 2018:** Skin Reflectance and BRDF   

**What is Reflectance?**  
* Reflectance is the property of a material using which it reflects light or other forms of energy, incident on its surface  
* Keeping the light source, direction and energy constant, different materials show different properties of reflectance  
* Hence reflectance is an important factor in determining/inferring the type of material 
* Observing the reflectance helps in better scene understanding as it gives very useful information like material type, whether the scene is indoors/outdoors and also in predicting how the objects would appear in a novel scene
* This applies to human faces too as the reflectance from human face vary from person to person and depends on several factors  
* Any feature that adds to or helps in encoding a human face into a unique representation, in turn helps in performing facial recognition 
* Facial recongnition includes many factors besides the physical facial features 
* Skin reflectance is a complex process as it depends on factors like skin color, blood flow beneath the skin etc which are different for different individuals  
* And this way reflectance too contributes to variable face appearances and face encoding  


**What is BRDF?** 
* Given an object of some material, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function defines how light is reflected from its surface  
* BRDF is a 4D function(four variable function)  which takes into consideration the incident light direction and its outgoing direction with respect to the surface normal  
* BRDF can be used to predict surface material type
