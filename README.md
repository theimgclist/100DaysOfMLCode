# 100DaysOfMLCode  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who’s ready to take the 100 days of ML code challenge? That means coding machine learning for at least an hour everyday for the next 100 days.

The above tweet explains how this repo started. This will be the journal for 100DaysOfMLCode pledge. I will add the progress I make everyday and will publish the code at regular intervals once I make enough progress with some task/problem.  

| Day        | Task           |   Updates      |   
| ------------- |:-------------|  :---------------- |  
| [Day 1](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day1) | Object Detection-Windows 10 |* Set up the environment on Windows 10(no GPU) </br> * Used TensorFlow and pre-trained SSDMobileNet </br> * Compared results with Yolo object detection |  
| [Day 2](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day2) | Object Detection-Ubuntu |* Set up the environment on Ubuntu(no GPU) </br> * Used TensorFlow and pre-trained FasterRCNN model </br> * Compared SSDLite with FasterRCNN |  
| [Day 3](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day3) | Real Time Object Detection |* Installed opencv </br> * Used TensorFlow and pre-trained SSDlite model </br> * Tried object detection on live camera feed |  
| [Day 4](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day4) | Object Detection using Google Colab |* Setup Colab for object detection</br> * Added comments and explanation for readability </br> * Used same code and instructions as Linux </br> * Added code to upload a new image for testing |  
| [Day 5](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day5) | Create dataset for gun detection |* Collected few hundred images of guns for retraining the model </br> * Found a relevant dataset</br> * Collected few more images from Internet </br> * Found a handy tool for downloading images |  
| [Day 6](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day6) | Write a blog |* Attended Uber Maps Tech Talk </br> * There were 2 talks</br> * Maps is a very interesting area to work on </br> * [Wrote a detailed blog](https://t.co/T2rpS2ICz1)|  
| [Day 7](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day7) | Annotate the dataset |* Used LabelImage for annotating the images </br> * Each image should be separately annotated</br> * Attended Actions on Google event |  
| [Day 8](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day8) | Model training |* Made some required configuration changes for training </br> * Faced few issues which I was able to resolve using GitHub Issues</br> * Reducing the batch size fixed OOM error|  
| [Day 9](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day9) | Continue model training |* Started the training again today  </br> * Been more than 5 hours so far and the loss has come down to 1.2</br> * I used the saved checkpoint to try object detection, it didnt work</br> * Training needs patience!|  
| [Day 10](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day10) | More model training |* Left the model to train since yesterday</br> * It has been training close to 30 hours!! </br> * The model gave bad results </br> * Pre-trained models are handy and helpful. But it doesn't mean we can settle with a specific one!|  
| [Day 11](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day11) | Finally some gun detection |* Training is much faster on Colab</br> * While each training step took 20-30secs on local CPU, on Colab it was 2-3 seconds </br> * Initial loss with ssd model was close to 30 </br> * Using faster rcnn, initial loss was 3 |  
| [Day 12](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day12) | Train using Faster RCNN |* Collected more images from IMFDB</br> * Used 250 images for training</br> * Took 20mins for the loss to reduce to 0.4 |   
| [Day 13](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day13) | Set up Raspberry Pi |* Recently got a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</br> * Setting up Raspberry Pi was easy </br> * Installed Raspbian OS</br> * VNC-Viewer is a handy tool for desktop sharing |
