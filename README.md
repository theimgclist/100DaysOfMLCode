| [Day 25](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day25) | SfSNet Architecture |* Training is done using an encoder-decoder network </br> * SfSnet is used for image decompostion and reconstruction </br> * Network is more than 80 layers deep | 
| [Day 26](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day26) | What are Normal Maps? |* Normal maps add more details to object surfaces  </br> * Gives an illusion of depth/height on the surface  </br> * Help in figuring out the geometry/shape of the scene/object |   
| [Day 27](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day27) | What are Albedo Maps? |* Best to remove highlights/shadows from texture maps  </br> * Using albedo maps highlights, shadows and light patches are removed</br> * This gives an even/homogeneous layer with only the color component |  
| [Day 28](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day28) | Skin Reflectance and BRDF |* Skin reflectance is a complex process </br> * Depends on factors like skin color, blood flow beneath the skin etc </br> * Reflectance too contributes to variable face appearances and face encoding |
