**Day 6 - 12th July, 2018:** Attended Uber Tech Talk        
* Uber Bangalore has organised few tech talks in 2018    
* This is the third one I attended so far this year  
* This tech talk is about Uber Maps  
* Maps are still unsolved, said one of the speakers  
* There were two presentations and both were equally good  
* Came to know many interesting things about how Maps work  
* Wrote a detailed [blog](https://medium.com/p/8df91c300f80/) about the talk on Medium

**What to try next :**  
* Annotate the gun dataset
