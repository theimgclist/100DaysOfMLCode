**Day 64 - 19th Sept, 2018:** Face ID Security(White Paper)

* Face ID is an iPhone X feature to automatically unlock the phone using face recognition
* It checks for gaze detection to detect user's attention
* Uses Deep Neural Networks for performing face detection, matching and anti spoofing
* Face ID is said to have a false match probability of 1 in 1,000,000
* While Face ID seems to be a promising face recognition tool, its false match is different when it is tried on twins/siblings who look alike
* It is also not that efficient on children below 13 years, as the distinct facial features may not be fully developed
* Face ID is powered by iPhone's TrueDepth camera
* It uses TrueDepth camera to project 30,000 infrared dots from the user's face
* These dots form depth map of the face and are used for face match and anti spoofing
* All of this happens right in the phone itself, with all the data within Secure Enclave 
* The neural network behind all this is trained over billion images that also include IR and depth images
* Face ID is expected to work even with hats, scarves, glasses and other eye-wear
