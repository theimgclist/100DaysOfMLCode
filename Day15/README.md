**Day 15 - 21st July, 2018:** Object Detection on Raspberry Pi Live Camera Feed  
* Added code for object detection on live camera feed  
* Used OpenCV for connecting to the USB camera  
* Object detection worked on live camera feed  
* There was some delay in the inference  
* It was because number of frames per second was close to 0.8  
* Using Pi camera instead of a USB camera might improve fps rate    
* Used the pre-trained model ssd_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28

**What to try next :**   
* Try the new models released from TensorFlow's Model Zoo  
* Get a pi camera
