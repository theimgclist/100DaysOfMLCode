**Day 68 to 70 - Oct 12th to 15th , 2018:** Participated in 2-Day Hackathon

* [InOut](https://hackinout.co/) is one of the biggest Indian community hackathons 
* I had the chance and time to work on building something along with several hundreds of other participants
* Teamed up with Utkarsh who I didn't know before attended the hackathon
* Few tech talks were organised on Friday evening before the start of hackathon 
* Starting the Saturday morning with a bag of swags and breakfast, we brainstormed for some ideas
* I went to the hackathon with no specific idea in mind to work on. But the brainstorming led to some and we finally decided to implement an automated store using Deep Learning
* For almost next 40 hours, we coded, talked, discussed, went around and met other participants, had food, broke what was working, fixed the broken code...
* Though we didn't end up building completelty what we wanted to, we ended up with a web-app that was doing face detection, verification pretty well
* I took care of using Deep Learning neural netowrk model to build the face detection and verification part while my team member built the UI
* There are many positive takeaways from this hackathon
* While I went to the hackathon, not knowing what to build, the 2 days offerecd a lot to learn
* The environment was encouraging, with people building interesting things
* More details about it will be shared in the blog
