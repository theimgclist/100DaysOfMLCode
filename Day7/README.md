**Day 7 - 13th July, 2018:** Annotated the dataset  
* Attended Actions on Goolge session organised at Google, Bangalore    
* It is easy to try and experiment with existing dataset that comes with annotations   
* Building own dataset and annotating each image in the dataset can be a tedious task  
* There are tools which help in making this task easier  
* As I am not aware of any such tool myself, I tried to find something good from the internet  
* I found few from a Quora answer [here](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-image-annotation-tools-available-out-there)  
* After trying a few, [LagelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) proved to be easy   
* It was also recommended in one of the videos I found on YouTube  
* Using the tool, I was able to quickly annotate the image  
* For every image in the dataset, I should draw a bounding box around the object of interest  
* And then input the object's classe name  
* In this example, gun will be the object class    

* <p align="center"><img src="\images\annotation.gif"/></p>  


**What to try next :**  
* Train the model on new gun dataset
