**Day 78 to 79 - Oct 23 to 24th , 2018:** Fast.ai Lecture 1(on-going course), Attended AMP Roadshow

* Fast.ai is one of the best courses on Deep Learning
* Version 3 of the Part-1 has started and it is available both for in-class and International students
* I took Part 2 which ended a few months back as an International student
* I finished going through all the seven lectures of part 1 from previous year
* Fast.ai has been one course which I keep reviewing from time to time
* It has a lot to offer than many other MOOCs
* Besides the useful lectures, fast.ai also provides a great community forum  


  
* AMP stands for Accelarated Mobile Pages
* It is an open source project developed to make web development both easy and smooth
* I knew only a little about AMP before I attended AMP roadshow, which like TensorFlow Roadshow is a full day community event
* In a nutshell, AMP's goal is to fix HTML and make web faster and friendlier
* The roadshow had a few talks and sessions which were good to give us all an idea and overview about how AMP works
* As I am building a webapp for Identity Management, I was interested to know how I can integrate AMP
* The main part of the existing webapp is the camera stream and face capturing
* AMP provides improved tags for HTML components like img in order to make them faster and more efficient
* I checked with Matt Ludwig, the Lead Product Manager for AMP if there is any AMP component for streaming video from camera
* Though AMP has no direct component for it, he said it would be a good feature to add
