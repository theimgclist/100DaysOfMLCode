**Day 16 - 22dn July, 2018:** TensorFlow Model Zoo 
* TensorFlow's Object Detection API has been very helpful  
* By spending an hour or two for setting up the environment, it can be deployed on all platforms   
* The best part of it is how it helps in understanding the flow/pipeline  
* After spending few days and trying different pre-trained models, it made many things clear and understandable  
* TensorFlow Model Zoo is a repository of many pre-trained models  
* These models can be deployed on devices like laptops and also mobiles/Raspberry Pi  
* ssd_mobilenet did well on laptops without GPU and mobile devices  
* TensorFlow recently released a pre-trained model with a new architecture  
* ssd_mobilenet_v1_ppn_coco pre-trained model is based on Pooling Pyramid Network architecture  
* PPN is a new variant of Single Shot Detector  
* This pre-trained model is more than 3x times smaller in size when compared to ssd_mobilenet  
* The loss in accuracy is also very minimal  
* ssd_mobilenet_v1_ppn pre-trained model is less than 50mb in size  
* This helps in performing real-time object detection even on low computation devices  
* Here's the [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03284) to the research paper on PPN architecture
