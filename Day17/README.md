**Day 17 - 23rd July, 2018:** Read about Face Processing 
* Read about how face detection, recognition and other face processing tasks work   
* Face image consists of several processing components  
* Shape of the face, reflectance and illuminance are three major components  
* Albedo map captures variations in skin pigmentation which is affected by blood flow beneath the skin  
* On a high level, the facial features are extracted and mapped to some latent space   
* Reflectance is the amount of incident energy that gets reflected from the surface  
* Different bodies and surfaces possess different reflecting properties  
* Hence prior reflectance data can be used to detect or recognise the surface  
* Detecting/Recognising a human face in an unconstrained environment is more complex  
* In case of unconstrained environment, a lot of external factors are dynamic  
* Comparatively face processing in a constrained environment is easier  
* In such a case, there will be some agreed upon standards in which the activity is tried
