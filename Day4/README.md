**Day 4 - 10th July, 2018:** Google Colab notebook with full code for object detection    
* Getting TensorFlow's Object Detection API working includes two tasks :  
* Setting up the environment and using the code for object detection     
* I tried using the API both on Windows and Linux and it worked fine  
* Google Colabaratory or sweetly Colab, is Google's research project  
* It comes with Linux environment and GPU!  
* It has been a very useful tool for researchers since it provides a platform to train and run models    
* The pre-trained models can be retrained in such a way that, the model learns very quickly    
* This way we can build a detection model to detect objects of interest(Maybe a Hotdog detector?)
* Now that I have a model that is working fine on Colab for detection, I can use Colab to train the model on new data      
* All Colab needs is a Gmail account  
* Upload [this](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/blob/master/Day4/ObjectDetectionOnColab.ipynb) notebook into Colab and start executing the cells   
* The code has few example images which are available to use for detection  
* I also added code to upload an image and try object detection

* Do you prefer cats or dogs to birds? Sure! Run the notebook and upload your image of interest and see if the model can detect it.    

**What to try next :**  
* No, not a hotdog detector!  
* Create a dataset for gun detector!
