**Day 19 - 29th July, 2018:** Research on Face Editing and Processing using Deep Learning   
* Deep Learning is finding its place in many applications  
* It is being used to solve many problems that were earlier solved using traditional algorithms and applications  
* Most of such works started as a research and are now being actively used  
* Computer vision tasks like Face Processing and Recognition are not novel and have existed for quite sometime  
* The same tasks are now being tried and done using Deep Learning   
* One such application of DL is Face Editing and Reconstruction  
* If you ever used Photoshop or know what it does, you can now do some of those things using DL  
* In a typical photo editing application, getting to the end result takes some series of effects that need to be applied  
* It can be simplified using Deep Learning approaches  
* Read few papers that are related to face editing using neural networks  
* There is a lot of Physics involved in face processing!

* Besides physical facial features extraction, face processing also involves image decomposition  
* Understanding facial brightness, reflectance and intensity is a key part  
* Face reconstruction has many use cases in Computer Graphics  
* The below two papers are about these tasks
